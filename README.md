## What is this?

This a website I made for my final project for Writing to Make Change with Ms. Thoms at Stuyvesant High School. It allows you to measure how gerrymandered the district maps are for different states, using a metric known as the [efficiency gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_gap).

It's not much but I felt like I should put it here.
